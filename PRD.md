Project Overview Develop a real-time messaging application similar to Slack, enabling seamless communication and collaboration for teams. The MVP will support user authentication, real-time messaging, channel organization, file sharing, threaded conversations, and administrative controls using Spring Boot, React, Postgres, and Clerk for authentication.

User Roles & Core Workflows

Admin
Mute users to prevent message sending in channels.
Admin
Delete users' messages to maintain content quality.
Admin
Delete user-created channels to manage workspace structure.
Regular User
Authenticate securely to access the messaging platform.
Regular User
Send and receive real-time messages within channels.
Regular User
Create, join, and organize channels and direct messages.
Regular User
Share and search for files within channels.
Regular User
Participate in threaded conversations for organized discussions.
Regular User
React to messages with emojis for quick feedback.
Technical Foundation

Data Models

User
id (UUID), username (String), email (String), role (Enum: ADMIN, USER), created_at (Timestamp)
Relationships: One-to-Many with Message, One-to-Many with Channel (as creator)
Channel
id (UUID), name (String), is_direct_message (Boolean), created_by (UUID referencing User), created_at (Timestamp)
Relationships: Many-to-Many with User through ChannelMembership, One-to-Many with Message
ChannelMembership
id (UUID), user_id (UUID referencing User), channel_id (UUID referencing Channel), joined_at (Timestamp)
Relationships: Many-to-One with User, Many-to-One with Channel
Message
id (UUID), content (Text), created_by (UUID referencing User), channel_id (UUID referencing Channel), parent_message_id (UUID referencing Message, nullable), created_at (Timestamp)
Relationships: Many-to-One with User, Many-to-One with Channel, Self-referential Many-to-One for threading
Reaction
id (UUID), emoji (String), user_id (UUID referencing User), message_id (UUID referencing Message), created_at (Timestamp)
Relationships: Many-to-One with User, Many-to-One with Message
File
id (UUID), file_url (String), uploaded_by (UUID referencing User), channel_id (UUID referencing Channel), filename (String), uploaded_at (Timestamp)
Relationships: Many-to-One with User, Many-to-One with Channel
